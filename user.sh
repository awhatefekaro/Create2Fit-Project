changed this file name from user,sh to user.sh
tried to commit it like a modified file and it failed.
lets try it now that we have modified the file
git commit -a -m
am sure it would work now perfecting...
lets see if the working tree is going to m=be clean 
by the above command.

Updating this file with more lines of supposed code
I will soon be typing python code like this
very fluently
